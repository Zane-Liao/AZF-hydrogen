- AgentOS aims to build a universal Agent World Runtime, providing agents with a highly abstract, operable, and scalable "digital world" runtime environment.Unlike traditional environments that focus on single tasks (such as Gym → RL), AgentOS aims to be: a unified world model and runtime that can be used by LLM, RL, planners, and tool-calling systems.
- It is not:
an agent framework
a game engine
a task-specific toolkit
- It is: an operating system-level world simulator that allows agents to truly "exist," "act," and "cooperate."
