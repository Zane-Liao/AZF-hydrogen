# AZF-hydrogen

- This is a new 2D game engine that is deeply integrated with AI.
- Some new features will be added to this game engine, such as Agent, reinforcement learning agent, world model, etc.
- The engine uses Hybrid ECS architecture, with more ECS. Initially, I planned to use OpenGL to implement it roughly, and then use WGPU to replace it.
- This game engine is experimental, In order to explore new things, I took it as an attempt. This was also my first attempt to build a medium-to-large-scale project from 0 to 1. Although it was only 2D, it included many features that had never been found in traditional game engines.
- I think the "from scratch" approach can help me understand the essence of programming and projects, as well as why many things need to be designed this way. The most important thing is that this gives me great freedom to verify what I want to add. I have tried some scaffolding-style teaching projects before, but I found that I was not interested in them. For me, it is more interesting to actually build the entire pipeline than to fill in the code spaces for a good scaffolding.
